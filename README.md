# Project-Moongate
_by Kemal Halilbegovic_

## Intro
This game is currently being made for pourposes of my graduation thesis on the Unreal Engine 4.

The game will feature a _turn-based_ battle system, along with a _third person_ view and movement when not in battle.
The graphics will include 3D models which will be by my own design using tools like Blender and Maya.
The game story will also be written by myself.

## Roadmap

### Short term goals
- April 2018
  - [ ] Implement functioning GUI for battlesystem
